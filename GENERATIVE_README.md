## Scenario 1: Code Explanation

The Code4z Assistant extension can explain COBOL code in a human-readable way. It uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to generate explanations for the code.

You can explain sections of a program or entire programs.

Follow these steps:

1. Select a COBOL program from the Explorer view. For example, navigate to: `MODERNIZATION-CARDDEMO` / `app` / `CBACT01C.cbl`.

2. To select all code, click inside the editor, then press `⌘`+`A` on macOS or `Ctrl`+`A` on Windows.

   The selected code is displayed in a panel on the right side of the VS Code window.
   
3. In the Code4z Assistant view, Type `Explain` and press Enter.

4. Ask follow-up questions as required. You can also select a specific part of the code and repeat the explanation process to focus on that part. To add the selected code to the chat, press  `⌘`+`L` on macOS or `Ctrl`+`L` on Windows.
